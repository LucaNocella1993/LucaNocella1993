- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luca Nocella, I'm graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science at the "Parthenope" University of Naples, and a participant in the training course of the Apple Developer Academy at the "Federico II" University of Naples, I currently work as a Java Developer with purely back-end tasks since many years.

Iâ€™m interested in Java and all that concern the back-end side of the applications, in particular I work with the framework Spring Boot.

Iâ€™m currently improving my competencies through work and study to become with the time a software architect.
